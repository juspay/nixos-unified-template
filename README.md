# nix-dev-home

A multi-platform Nix configuration template optimized as development environment, based on [nixos-unified]. See [`./modules`](modules/) to see what's available.

[nix-darwin]: https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin
[home-manager]: https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager
[NixOS]: https://nixos.asia/en/nixos-tutorial
[nixos-unified]: https://nixos-unified.org

## Status

We currently support [home-manager] (see `./modules/home`) and [nix-darwin] (see `./modules/darwin`); NixOS support is in progress (see https://github.com/juspay/nix-dev-home/issues/86).

| Platform    | Supported By                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| macOS       | âœ… [home-manager] and/or [nix-darwin]   |
| NixOS       | âœ… [home-manager] and ðŸš§ NixOS  |
| Other Linux | âœ… [home-manager] only                       |

## Getting Started

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.asia/en/install):
    ```sh-session
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
      sh -s -- install --no-confirm --extra-conf "trusted-users = $(whoami)"
    ```
1. Open a new terminal; Initialize[^omnix] your Nix configuration using this repo as template:
    ```sh-session
    mkdir ~/nixconfig && cd ~/nixconfig
    nix --accept-flake-config run github:juspay/omnix -- \
      init github:juspay/nix-dev-home -o .
    ```

    - It will prompt to you choose between [home-manager] only configuration and [nix-darwin] configuration. The latter includes [home-manager] as well.
    - Optionally, you may edit `./modules/{home,darwin}/*.nix` to your liking.
1. Run `nix run` (or the appropriate command printed by the above command) to activate your configuration.
    - Does this fail to run? See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.
1. Restart your terminal.

After steps 1-4, you should expect to see the [starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt:

Whenever you modify your configuration in `./modules/*/*.nix`, you should re-run `nix run` to activate the new configuration.

[^omnix]: We use [omnix](https://omnix.page/om/init.html) to initialize this repository template.

## Details

The configuration repo has `flake.nix` file in the current directory and some `./modules/{home,darwin}/*.nix` files containing the [home-manager] and [nix-darwin] configurations respectively that you can review. It also has a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just), which provides a set of recipes analogous to Make targets to interact with the nix flake.

You can then execute `nix develop`, to ensure you are in the development shell with [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, followed by `just run` (or `nix run`) to activate this configuration in your system.

If you prefer, you can simply execute `nix run`, but using `just` will perform some additional validation and ensure you are able to use the other commands in the [justfile](./justfile).

To browse the capabilities of [home-manager] (and to see what else can go in your `./modules/home/*.nix` -- such as shell aliases), consult [home-manager options reference](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml). You can also run `man home-configuration.nix` in the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

### `error: opening lock file ...`

**Problem**: `nix run` shows an error like: `error: opening lock file '/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/utkarsh.pandey1/profile.lock': No such file or directory`

**Solution**: This is an instance of https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/4611. Run `sudo mkdir /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$(whoami)/ && sudo chown $(whoami) /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$(whoami)` and try again.

### Cannot use cache / cachix

**Problem**: Cannot use cachix: Running `nix run nixpkgs#cachix use nammayatri` (for example) does not succeed.

**Solution**: Add yourself to the `trusted-users` nix config and restart the nix daemon.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "trusted-users = root $(whoami)" >> $HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf
sudo pkill nix-daemon
```

## FAQ

### `/nix/store` garbage collection

By default, [home-manager] is configured to run garbage collection automatically every week. If your projects use nix-direnv, you don't have to worry about having to download the dependencies again while in a remote area with limited internet access ([see prominent features of nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv#nix-direnv)).
